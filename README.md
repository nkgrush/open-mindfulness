# open-mindfulness

## About
It does what it should and nothing more. A simple app to keep you mindful throughout your day. \
I wrote it because other apps have too much unwanted features and there are only a few open source alternatives.

Feel free to submit pull requests and issues!

## Non-fetures which will _never_ be implemented
- Bloated interface.
- Unneeded buttons and text.
- Anything which prevents you just 'doing the thing'.
- Ads or anything privacy intrusive.

## TODO features
- Daily notification.
- Better notifications.
- Change accent color.
- A screen with progress stats.
- And charts!

## Building from source
The app depends on React Native CLI environment. First, you need to set up React Native CLI by following the [official guide.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)  
Clone this repo and install dependencies.
```
git clone 'github.com/nkgrush/open-mindfulness'
npm install
```
After you've done start Metro.
```
npx react-native start
```
And flash a test build to your android phone (or an emulator).
```
npx react-native run-android
```

## Privacy policy
I firmly believe in open source software and user privacy.
The Open Mindfulness app does not collect or transmit any personal data, because it is not needed for the app to function.
